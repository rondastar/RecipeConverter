# RecipeConverter
 
 This recipe converter is my first personal project, which I started halfway through first quarter. I chose this project because I enjoy baking recipes from places I have lived abroad, and I used to go through recipes and research how to convert quantities of different types of ingredients from metric to US and vice versa. 

 I came across a website that allows visitors to paste an entire recipe into a text box, and it displays the converted recipe, and I was curious about how it works. While this app isn't very far along yet, I plan to keep working on this to add more functionality as my skills grow.

 So far I have begun to learn a little about project organization as I have thought through how the methods will interact with each other. I also learned that a number with a decimal in a float array needs to be cast explicitly, which can be done by including F at the end of the number (e.g., 2.5F).
